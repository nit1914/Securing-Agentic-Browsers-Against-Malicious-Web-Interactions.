## 📌 Problem Statement

With the rise of agentic browsers and AI-driven automation, browsers can now perform tasks autonomously. However, this introduces serious security and privacy risks such as unauthorized actions, data leakage, and lack of user control. Traditional browser security mechanisms are not sufficient to handle autonomous agent behavior.

## ✨ Key Features

- Permission-based execution for autonomous browser actions  
- Real-time monitoring of AI agent behavior  
- Secure session handling to protect sensitive data  
- Intelligent detection of suspicious or malicious activities  
- User-in-the-loop control for high-risk operations  
- Privacy-first design principles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Web-based UI (Lovable / Frontend tools)
- AI Agent Architecture
- Security & Access Control Logic
- Session Management Techniques

*(Tech stack can be expanded as the project evolves)*

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user initiates tasks using an agentic browser.
2. Each autonomous action is checked against predefined permissions.
3. Agent behavior is continuously monitored in real time.
4. Suspicious activities are detected and blocked automatically.
5. Users can intervene or override actions when required.
6. Secure sessions ensure data privacy throughout the interaction.

## ⚠️ Challenges Addressed

- Preventing unauthorized agent actions  
- Maintaining performance while monitoring agents  
- Avoiding false positives in threat detection  
- Balancing automation with user control  
- Ensuring privacy and data security  

---

## 🌍 Impact

This solution enables safer adoption of agentic browsers in sensitive environments such as enterprises, research, and personal productivity tools. It builds trust in AI-driven browsing by ensuring transparency, accountability, and security.
